## How to contribute

Fork repository, make changes, send us a pull request. We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

> mvn clean install -Pqulice

Keep in mind that JDK7 and Maven 3.1.0 are the lowest versions you may use.
