Source Code Quality Police (Qulice)

  Qulice is a {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis}static analysis}}
  quality control instrument for
  Java projects. It combines a few static analysis tools and
  pre-configure them. You don't need to use and configure them individually any more.

  At the moment we integrate together:

   * {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/analyze-only-mojo.html}Maven dependency analysis}}

   * {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-enforcer-plugin/enforce-mojo.html}maven-enforcer-plugin}}

   * {{{https://github.com/ning/maven-duplicate-finder-plugin}maven-duplicate-finder-plugin}}

   * {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}Checkstyle}}

   * {{{http://pmd.sourceforge.net/}PMD}}

   * {{{http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/}FindBugs}}

  Just add our {{{./qulice-maven-plugin/}qulice-maven-plugin}} to your
  Maven project and start following out
  {{{./quality.html}quality policy}}:
