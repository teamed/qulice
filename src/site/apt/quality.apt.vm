What is Quality and how to achieve it?

  Quality Java code, as we understand it, compiles and complies to
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis}static analysis}}
  rules. Qulice uses a number of open-source components (in order to avoid
  reinventing the wheel). We pre-configured these tools for your convenience
  and extended them with our specific rules.

* Checkstyle

  {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/checks.html}Inherited rules}}.

  Our custom rules:

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/BracketsStructureCheck.html}BracketsStructure}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/ConstantUsageCheck.html}ConstantUsage}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/EmptyLinesCheck.html}EmptyLines}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/ImportCohesionCheck.html}ImportCohesion}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/JavadocLocationCheck.html}JavadocLocation}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/JavadocTagsCheck.html}JavadocTags}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/MethodBodyCommentsCheck.html}MethodBodyComments}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/MultilineJavadocTagsCheck.html}MultilineJavadocTags}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/NonStaticMethodCheck.html}NonStaticMethod}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/StringLiteralsConcatenationCheck.html}StringLiteralsConcatenation}}

   * {{{./qulice-checkstyle/apidocs-${project.version}/com/qulice/checkstyle/JavadocEmptyLineCheck.html}JavadocEmptyLine}}

  If you want to disable some rule (this may happen, but try to avoid such
  situations at all cost):

+--
/**
 * @checkstyle ParameterNumber (3 lines)
 */
public void funcWithManyParams(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
  // @checkstyle MagicNumber (1 line)
  int num = 5;
  // ...
}
+--

* PMD

  {{{http://pmd.sourceforge.net/rules/index.html}Inherited rules}}.

  Rules can be disabled (again, try to avoid this at all cost):

+--
@SuppressWarnings("PMD.UseConcurrentHashMap")
public void func() {
  Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
  // ...
}
+--
