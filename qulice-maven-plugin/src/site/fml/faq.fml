            <question>How can I setup proxy needed to download and validate schemas?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Standard Maven proxy set in `settings.xml` doesn't work, because information
                    about it is not passed to underlying validators. However, standard
                    [JVM proxy](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html)
                    configuration works fine. To use it just add `-Dhttp.proxyHost=HOST -Dhttp.proxyPort=PORT`
                    to your `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable or to Maven command, e.g.
                    `mvn clean verify -Dhttp.proxyHost=HOST -Dhttp.proxyPort=PORT`.
